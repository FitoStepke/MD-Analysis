    """
    Analyze a single Ca2+ position assignment file to compute the ratio (events per microsecond)
    of site transitions, with tolerance for short OUT periods (max_out_frames).

    Parameters:
        timestep_fs (float): Trajectory timestep in femtoseconds (fs). Use 1000 if each frame is 1 ps.
        max_out_frames (int): Maximum consecutive OUT frames tolerated before site is considered abandoned.
        min_valid_frames (int): Minimum frames spent in a site for a transition to be counted as an event.
